// chunk sort
// - Divide the ranks into subsets
// - Pick out the subsets one at a time
//         - b will be largest first, so start with smallest ranks
//         - Find the first elem of the current subset from the top of a
//         - Find the first elem of the current subset from the bottom of a
//         - Find which is fastest to move to b
//         - ? Find the spot in b in which it goes
//         - Rotate or rrotate a (and b ? ) in position and push it to b; pb
//         - Rotate b so largest rank is at the top 
// - repeat for all other subsets 
// - rotate b to have largest first
// - push b to a

// merge sort
// initalise
//		split_a recursively until a is a sorted pair
//		set sort_sizes_a to 0
//		every call adds a node to sort_sizes_b
// while (!is_sorted(a) && there is something in b)
//		if (sort_sizes_a > 0)
//			split_a (change sort_sizes_a and add node to sort_sizes_b)
//				rotates down the largest and pushes the smallest halves
//			rrotate the larger half back up
//		else if (sort_sizes_b > 0)
//			send b back to a and remove sort_sizes_b and add node to 
//			sort_sizes_a

// Radix sort optimisations?
// Unfortunately you have to rotate a fully to keep the list sorted
// Won't work with ranks:
//		Identify radixes that don't require sorting to eliminate a whole step?
// Do a bloody handstand.
